/**
 * A service that can help serialize a node to JSON. Implementations of this interface will be invoked by
 * {@link ResourceToJsonAdapterFactory} when serializing a resource as JSON.
 * <p>
 * Each implementation has a {@link #getName() name} that can be used to enable or disable it. Selecting which modules
 * to use when serializing a resource is done through the resource's selectors. This can be accomplished by appending
 * them in the request URL for a resource, for example <tt>http://server.example/path/to/resource.deep.simple.json</tt>,
 * or by appending them in the resource path when using {@code ResourceResolver#resolve}, for example
 * {@code resourceResolver.resolve("/path/to/resource.deep.simple")}. Some implementations are
 * {@link #isEnabledByDefault(Resource) enabled by default} for all, or just some resources, like the {@code properties}
 * processor that serializes all property names. To disable some of these default processors, prefix their name with
 * {@code -} in the list of selectors, for example {@code /path/to/resource.-dereference.json}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The enabled processors will be called one after another, in ascending order of their {@link #getPriority() priority},
 * receiving the serialized value computed by the previous processor, starting with {@code null}. If, at the end of the
 * process, the result is {@code null}, then that property or child is not included in the output. To serialize a
 * property or child as {@code null}, return {@code JsonValue.NULL}. The name under which a property or child is
 * serialized is its actual name by default, and this cannot be changed by the {@link #processProperty} or
 * {@link #processChild} methods. Changing the key names, or adding extra keys in the JSON, can be accomplished using the
 * {@link #leave} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For each serialized node, first all its properties are serialized using {@link #processProperty}, then all its
 * children using {@link #processChild}, then the output is post-processed using {@link #leave}.
 * </p>
