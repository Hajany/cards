## YOUR EXPERIENCE Terms of Use

By using or accessing the YOUR EXPERIENCE Application, you agree to these Terms (“**Terms**”). These Terms are a legal agreement between you and the University Health Network (“**UHN**”). If you do not agree to all of these Terms, do not use the application and do not submit the survey through the application. Note that completing surveys through YOUR EXPERIENCE is completely voluntary and declining to do so will not impact the quality of your care.  If you do use the application, relying on any information you see in the application is solely at your own risk. 

### What these Terms will tell you:

1. The purpose of YOUR EXPERIENCE
2. Limits of YOUR EXPERIENCE
3. Your Responsibilities
4. How we Protect your Privacy
5. How to get your Questions Answered

### 1. Purpose of YOUR EXPERIENCE

This section describes the reasons that YOUR EXPERIENCE was created, which are the same as the services (“**Services**”) offered to you by UHN.

The main purpose of YOUR EXPERIENCE is to act as an information collection tool for understanding how patients perceived the interactions with their health care providers at the hospital to provide anonymous, agregated reports to the Ministry regarding patient satisfaction.  The Application is intended to facilitate patient experience feedback to administrators, and to support quality monitoring and improvement.  The information collected from you through YOUR EXPERIENCE will only be used for the purposes described here.  

In future your data may be further used to improve services at UHN or for research purposes, where such research is approved by a Research Ethics Board.  UHN takes your privacy seriously.  To learn more about UHN’s privacy practices please see the following pamphlet: [Privacy At the University Health Network](https://www.uhn.ca/PatientsFamilies/Health_Information/Health_Topics/Documents/Privacy_at_UHN.pdf).

#### Collection, Use and Disclosure of Data 
a) **Transmission of non-Identifying data to UHN**. The Application collects data (user metrics), which is transmitted back to UHN through the Application.  The information that is collected is aggregate and anonymous data relating to the use of the Application (e.g., number of users accessing the Application per day, the number of surveys submitted, etc.) in order for UHN to better understand use of the Application and to help us identify areas for improvement. If you do not consent to the transmission of this data to UHN, then you must not use YOUR EXPERIENCE.  

b) **Transmission and Storage of Identifying Data and PHI**. The Application doesn not collect the users' personal information or PHI.  The YOUR EXPERIENCE Servers are hosted at University Health Network. Information stored on UHN Servers is accessible by UHN authorized staff at these sites. More information can be found in the Application Privacy Policy. 

### 2. Limits of YOUR EXPERIENCE

The YOUR EXPERIENCE App is not a medical device. Nothing contained in YOUR EXPERIENCE should be construed, directly or indirectly, as the practice of medicine or providing medical advice or medical services by UHN. The Application is not intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or other conditions.  

All information provided to you in YOUR EXPERIENCE is provided for your information only. This means that: 
- Use of YOUR EXPERIENCE is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.  If you have or suspect you have a health problem, please consult your care provider. 
- If you have or suspect you are experiencing a health emergency, please call 911 or visit the nearest Emergency Department in your area.

The YOUR EXPERIENCE App and content are provided are on an “as is” basis. This means that: 
- While UHN will take all steps it considers to be reasonable in making sure that your information is protected, accurate and available to you, UHN assumes no liability for a delay, failure, inaccuracy, interruption or corruption of any information transmitted via YOUR EXPERIENCE. 
- UHN reserves the right to change, suspend or deactivate YOUR EXPERIENCE at any time. 
- UHN reserves the right to change these Terms at any time and will make these changes available to you the next time you access YOUR EXPERIECE. Using YOUR EXPERIENCE after these changes have been made means that you agree to the changes. 

#### No Regulatory Approval

YOUR EXPERIENCE has not been evaluated by Health Canada, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) or any other domestic or foreign regulatory agency and is not approved to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or for the prescription of any medication or treatment. While the information contained may be of use in other jurisdictions, these materials were provided and designed for use in Canada and you are solely responsible for ensuring suitability and permitted use in other jurisdictions.  

### 3. Your Rights and Responsibilities

You received the email containing your link to YOUR EXPERIENCE because you consented to the use of email by UHN to communicate with you about your care.  If you change your mind and no longer want to receive emails about YOUR EXPERIENCE, or any emails from UHN, it is your responsibility to let us know.  To communicate this instruction, contact your care provider and/or the UHN Privacy Office at the contact information below.

While the information you are asked to provide through the survey is being used to support your care and for quality improvement, you are not required to complete the survey. You may refuse to complete the survey and you will still be able to receive care from UHN.  Your clinician may ask you the same or similar questions to those in the survey at your scheduled appointment if you have not submitted the survey.

Once you have decided to use YOUR EXPERIENCE and start completing your survey information, it is your responsibility to protect it. UHN is not liable for breaches that result from you not taking the following steps to protect your information. By using the YOUR EXPERIENCE, you agree to take these steps:
- Ensure that no one is “shoulder-surfing” or watching you when viewing or adding in your information. 
    - You agree to choose more private spaces (like your home) over public ones (like on public transportation). 
    - You agree to not use a public computer to access YOUR EXPERIENCE (like in a library). 
    - You agree to not use free and/or untrusted Wi-Fi to access the YOUR EXPERIENCE survey.
- Tell your care provider or the UHN Privacy Office (contact information below) about any suspicious activity so we can investigate it. During an investigation an audit may be done of those who accessed your information. Malicious activity will be addressed according to hospital policy and/or as permitted by law.

### 4. How we Protect your Privacy

In collecting and using your personal health information in YOUR EXPERIENCE, UHN must follow the rules set out in the Personal Health Information Protection Act.

UHN takes steps to make sure that your information is safeguarded by meeting best practice standards for security. UHN has individuals who review any potential changes to the App to make sure that the changes are lawful and protect your privacy to the best of our ability. A privacy review, security review and Vulnerability Test were completed by experts in their fields to ensure that legal requirements are met and best practices are followed. Key functions of YOUR EXPERIENCE are regularly reviewed and checked, and changes are made where necessary. UHN has taken steps to make sure that information is backed up, updated regularly and is available to you when you need it.
